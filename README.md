# Chatbot-using-deep-learning

## About this Project
Gimsy is a multipurpose chatbot made using Python3, who can chat with you and help in performing daily tasks. It uses NLP and Deep-Learning to analyse the user's message, classify it into the a broader category and then reply with a suitable message or the required information. It is hosted using flask and is available on heroku at the link specified above.

First, the user message is lemmatized and pre-processed, before passing it to the deep-learning model used, an Artificial Neural Network with Softmax, to specify the query category which achieves an accuracy of over 93%.
